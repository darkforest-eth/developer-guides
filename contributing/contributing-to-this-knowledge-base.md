# Contributing to this knowledge base

Edits and new guides to the site are always appreciated, but need to be audited for security so are a best effort to be merged by the maintainers and could take a long time. We appreciate your patience.

Fork the [repo](https://github.com/darkforest-eth/developer-guides) and open a PR.

source Ethereum contracts. This means you can hack literally every other part of the experience to your liking.\nDark forest publishes npm packages for its contract addresses, types, and utilities functions and releases an official subgraph to ease your development workflow.\nPlugins Developers\nAnyone can get started scripting with the Dark Forest Console. Just look out for the command that is printed from your mouse actions. You can copy and repaste that command to run it again any time, or modify it slightly to try something new. Mostly you'll just be replaying a command so dont worry too much about breaking anything, give it a shot. The df object and the ui object are the main api surfaces for plugins developers so you'll want to familiarize yourself.\nOur community plugins developers have written mini maps, automation plugins, remote miners and much much more. Check the Dark Forest Community Plugins Showcase for inspiration and to copy existing plugins and make them your own. Please join the community by submitting your plugins back there as well.\nClient developers\nBy forking the React/WebGL client frontend and running one yarn command you'll be running a webpack local dev client against mainnet. This allows you to edit the client to your liking customizing any part of the game and the license even allows you to fork to your own open source version and publish to IPFS or a static site host like netlify to share with your guild or friends.\nContract Developers\nIf you're interested in Ethereum smart contract development and Hardhat tooling we release all smart contract source code and scripts used in developing and maintaining the game\nBut thats not all. With that knowledge you should be able to write contracts that interact with the mainnet Dark Forest universe, no permission needed. See the Sophon Reveal Marketplace example for a contract that lets users sell their daily reveal to the first bidder.\nCircuits developers\nDark Forest's innovative gameplay comes in no small part from its ZK circuits design utilizing iden3's circomlib\nUnaudited Community Resources\nWARNING\nNothing in the Dark Forest ecosystem has any guarantee of being audited. Smart contracts could be malicious or be found to be insecure. Further, all plugins and pasted code in the Dark Forest console have access to your private key and ability to sign transactions (without a cpnfirmation popup). This means they could now or in the future take all your funds, planets, artifacts etc from your burner wallet. You should rotate burner wallets often, not keep more funds or nfts than you're willing to lose, and be careful using any plugins that you haven't written yourself or by someone you trust completely. Further, some plugins dynamically load dependencies under the hood meaning a 'safe' plugin could become unsafe in the future! All use is at your own risk.\nTheres a whole wild world of amazing community creations. They're mostly being tracked at the awesome darkforest repo\n"},"connecting-to-xdai/what-is-an-rpc-endpoint.html":{"url":"connecting-to-xdai/what-is-an-rpc-endpoint.html","title":"What is an RPC endpoint?","keywords":"","body":"What is an RPC endpoint?\nAs a decentralized game, Dark Forest stores all public game data on a blockchain. Currently, Dark Forest v0.6 is run on the xDAI blockchain--an EVM compatible sidechain.\nTo connect to and retrieve data from a blockchain, you'll need to connect to a node on the blockchain network. A node is a participant in the network that stores and serves the latest blockchain state. Users who wish to download blockchain data can either run a node themselves, or connect to a publicly-provided node via the node's RPC endpoint. An RPC (remote procedure call) endpoint is like a node's address: it's a URL which requests for blockchain data can be sent to.\nThe Ethereum JSON-RPC spec defines the methods which you can use to retrieve data from a node. As a player or 3rd-party developer, you likely won't need to make RPC calls directly with this API--these calls are typically abstracted by web3 libraries like ethers.js.\nBy default, the Dark Forest webclient will connect to https://rpc-df.xdaichain.com/, a public endpoint provided by the xDAI team. xDAI maintains a fleet of nodes which respond to requests made to this endpoint. There are other public endpoints you can connect to as well; if you'd like a dedicated node to serve your requests, you can also run your own xDAI node and connect to the endpoint it exposes.\n"},"connecting-to-xdai/changing-your-rpc-endpoint.html":{"url":"connecting-to-xdai/changing-your-rpc-endpoint.html","title":"Changing your RPC endpoint","keywords":"","body":"Changing your RPC endpoint\nYou can change the RPC endpoint that the Dark Forest client connects to in the settings pane of the game.\n\nIn addition to the xDAI-provided https://rpc-df.xdaichain.com endpoint, xDAI also provides a number of other public endpoints.\nLast but not least, Pocket Network has gifted the Dark Forest community an xDAI RPC load-balanced endpoint capable of handling up to 10,000,000 requests per day by staking upwards of 250k POKT on their behalf.\nhttps://poa-xdai.gateway.pokt.network/v1/lb/60b13899d3279c22da2a444d\nOvertime, this will be scaled up to handle more traffic!\n"},"connecting-to-xdai/running-your-own-xdai-node.html":{"url":"connecting-to-xdai/running-your-own-xdai-node.html","title":"Running your own xDAI node","keywords":"","body":"Running your own xDAI node\nThis article is a stub.

Plugins are snippets of code that players can write to generate alternate views of game data, automate common gameplay flows, or even reskin the game. Essentially, Dark Forest allows players can interact programmatically with the webclient in any way they'd like.\nWe encourage players to share plugins with the larger community. A community-maintained plugins showcase can be found here, with the underlying source code available in this repository. Follow the instructions in the plugins showcase README to submit your plugin to the repository.\nIt's worth noting that plugins are evaluated in the context of your game and can access all of your private information (including your burner wallet private key!). Additionally, plugins can dynamically load data, which can be switched out from under you. Use these plugins at your own risk.\nTherefore, it can be dangerous to use any plugins that you haven't written/reviewed yourself or by someone you trust completely. You or someone you trust should control the entire pipeline (such as imported dependencies) and should review plugins before you use them.\n"},"plugins/writing-your-first-plugin.html":{"url":"plugins/writing-your-first-plugin.html","title":"Writing your first plugin","keywords":"","body":"Writing your first plugin\nThis article is a stub.

These hashes are saved to your browser's local storage, and are considered secret data.\n\nBy default, the Dark Forest default web client uses a single-threaded Javascript miner to explore the universe, but there are a number of things that you can do to increase your hashrate.\nYou can set your webclient to use additional cores next to the play pause mining button.

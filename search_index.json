for Dark Forest!","summary":"Dark Forest developer resources","keywords":"","body":"Developing for Dark Forest\nWith Ethereum gaming, the closed source server model has been replaced by a few open source Ethereum contracts. This means you can hack literally every other part of the experience to your liking.\nDark forest publishes npm packages for its contract addresses, types, and utilities functions and releases an official subgraph to ease your development workflow.\nPlugins Developers\nAnyone can get started scripting with the Dark Forest Console. Just look out for the command that is printed from your mouse actions. You can copy and repaste that command to run it again any time, or modify it slightly to try something new. Mostly you'll just be replaying a command so dont worry too much about breaking anything, give it a shot. The df object and the ui object are the main api surfaces for plugins developers so you'll want to familiarize yourself.\nOur community plugins developers have written mini maps, automation plugins, remote miners and much much more. Check the Dark Forest Community Plugins Showcase for inspiration and to copy existing plugins and make them your own. Please join the community by submitting your plugins back there as well.\nClient developers\nBy forking the React/WebGL client frontend and running one yarn command you'll be running a webpack local dev client against mainnet. This allows you to edit the client to your liking customizing any part of the game and the license even allows you to fork to your own open source version and publish to IPFS or a static site host like netlify to share with your guild or friends.\nContract Developers\nIf you're interested in Ethereum smart contract development and Hardhat tooling we release all smart contract source code and scripts used in developing and maintaining the game\nBut thats not all. With that knowledge you should be able to write contracts that interact with the mainnet Dark Forest universe, no permission needed. See the Sophon Reveal Marketplace example for a contract that lets users sell their daily reveal to the first bidder.\nCircuits developers\nDark Forest's innovative gameplay comes in no small part from its ZK circuits design utilizing iden3's circomlib\nUnaudited Community Resources\nWARNING\nNothing in the Dark Forest ecosystem has any guarantee of being audited. Smart contracts could be malicious or be found to be insecure. Further, all plugins and pasted code in the Dark Forest console have access to your private key and ability to sign transactions (without a cpnfirmation popup). This means they could now or in the future take all your funds, planets, artifacts etc from your burner wallet. You should rotate burner wallets often, not keep more funds or nfts than you're willing to lose, and be careful using any plugins that you haven't written yourself or by someone you trust completely. Further, some plugins dynamically load dependencies under the hood meaning a 'safe' plugin could become unsafe in the future! All use is at your own risk.\nTheres a whole wild world of amazing community creations. They're mostly being tracked at the awesome darkforest repo\n"},"connecting-to-xdai/what-is-an-rpc-endpoint.html":{"url":"connecting-to-xdai/what-is-an-rpc-endpoint.html","title":"What is an RPC endpoint?","keywords":"","body":"What is an RPC endpoint?\nAs a decentralized game, Dark Forest stores all public game data on a blockchain. Currently, Dark Forest v0.6 is run on the xDAI blockchain--an EVM compatible sidechain.\nTo connect to and retrieve data from a blockchain, you'll need to connect to a node on the blockchain network. A node is a participant in the network that stores and serves the latest blockchain state. Users who wish to download blockchain data can either run a node themselves, or connect to a publicly-provided node via the node's RPC endpoint. An RPC (remote procedure call) endpoint is like a node's address: it's a URL which requests for blockchain data can be sent to.\nThe Ethereum JSON-RPC spec defines the methods which you can use to retrieve data from a node. As a player or 3rd-party developer, you likely won't need to make RPC calls directly with this API--these calls are typically abstracted by web3 libraries like ethers.js.\nBy default, the Dark Forest webclient will connect to https://rpc-df.xdaichain.com/, a public endpoint provided by the xDAI team. xDAI maintains a fleet of nodes which respond to requests made to this endpoint. There are other public endpoints you can connect to as well; if you'd like a dedicated node to serve your requests, you can also run your own xDAI node and connect to the endpoint it exposes.\n"},"connecting-to-xdai/changing-your-rpc-endpoint.html":{"url":"connecting-to-xdai/changing-your-rpc-endpoint.html","title":"Changing your RPC endpoint","keywords":"","body":"Changing your RPC endpoint\nYou can change the RPC endpoint that the Dark Forest client connects to in the settings pane of the game.\n\n\nIn addition to the game default xDAI-provided https://rpc-df.xdaichain.com endpoint, xDAI also provides a number of other public endpoints.\nYou can also run your own node locally or on the cloud\nCloud providers like Quicknode will run a node for you with a few clicks for a monthly fee.\nLast but not least, Pocket Network has gifted the Dark Forest community an xDAI RPC load-balanced endpoint node at https://poa-xdai.gateway.pokt.network/v1/lb/60b13899d3279c22da2a444d\n\n"},"connecting-to-xdai/running-your-own-xdai-node.html":{"url":"connecting-to-xdai/running-your-own-xdai-node.html","title":"Running your own xDAI node","keywords":"","body":"How to run your own xDai Node on Digital Ocean\nWhy run your own xDai Node?\n\nNo queue of other people's transactions\nNo downtime. Thousands of other players are attempting to use the same free rpc endpoint as you otherwise!\nFaster access. The memory and cpu speed of the free rpc is not published. By running your own node you can use a beefier box. \n\nThe clients that have known xDai support include OpenEthereum (formerly Parity) and Nethermind. \nWhy Nethermind\nfrom xDai docs\n\nA majority of xDai validators are now running the Nethermind client. The latest version includes support for MEV via flashbots and increased default xDAI TxPool size from 1024 transactions to 2048.\n\nWhy Digital Ocean for hosting\nfrom Nethermind docs\n\nGenerally the faster IO operations the better. For this reason Digital Ocean and UpCloud are so far the best cloud providers we have tested when running Nethermind nodes.\n\n1. Setting up a Digital Ocean Instance\n\nBuy a droplet (cloud computer). I recommend a machine with at least the following specs ($40/month):\n\nUbuntu 20.4 / 8 GB / 4 CPUs 160 GB SSD Disk 5 TB transfer\nIf this too slow, I synced a node in ~6 hours with the $80/month option\nIf your sync is very slow (extended beyond two days) then very likely your setup cannot catch up with the chain progress.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemotely connect to the Droplet using ssh.

Install Nethermind and dependencies\nNote: these commands are verbatim from here\n\nwget [NETHERMIND_URL] - use the most recent linux amd64 release from downloads)  Probably something like wget https://nethdev.blob.core.windows.net/builds/nethermind-linux-amd64-1.11.3-fe90423.zip\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev libc6-dev libc6 unzip -y - Linux dependencies\nunzip NETHERMIND_URL -d nethermind - unzip to nethermind folder\n\nAt this point, I diverged from the basic installation. This is because there are some specific configuration settings that are nice for running a node (and playing Dark Forest). \n3. Configure Nethermind for Dark Forest\nSo in the nethermind folder you will see Nethermind.Launcher and Nethermind.Runner.\n\n\n\nFrom ethhub\n\nNethermind.Launcher is an interactive prompt that allows you to choose the network which then calls Nethermind.Runner with the appropriate config file. This is the quickest way to get up and running.\nNethermind.Runner is the actual client binary similar to the geth binary and supports both cli options or a JSON configuration file. Nethermind.Runner --config \n\nI added some custom configurations, so I choose to use the Nethermind.Runner binary with my custom config file.\n\ncd nethermind \n\nWe want to sync an xDai node, so here are the options for xDai (xdai_dfdao is my custom config): \n\nI choose to copy xdai_pruned_mev.cfg because:\nI want the experiment with mev on xDai\nI want to save size by pruning, at the cost of historical queries:  \npruning is the process of removing some of the intermediary state nodes - it saves some disk space but makes most of the historical state queries fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncp configs/CONFIG_FILE configs/YOUR_CONFIGNAME\n\nfor me, this was cp configs/xdai_pruned_mev.cfg configs/xdai_dfdao.cfg\n\n\n\nEdit your config file with something like nano configs/xdai_dfdao.cfg and change the following fields to allow access to your node from the internet:\n\nYour JSON RPC should look like this:\"JsonRpc\": {\n\"Enabled\": true,\n\"Timeout\": 20000,\n\"Host\": \"IP ADDRESS\",\n\"Port\": 8545,\n\"WebSocketsPort\": 8546,\n\"EthModuleConcurrentInstances\": 6\n}\n\nUnder Network add a new field.\"Network\": {\n...\n \"ActivePeersMaxCount\": 256,\n\nif you have a good connection and a reasonable machine then setting --Network.MaxActiveSyncPeers to 256 (see NetworkConfig secion in configuration) should give much better fast sync times (we use 256 peers to get 5 hours syncs)\n\nNote that even though ActivePeersMaxCount is deprecated, this setting worked for me (and MaxActiveSyncPeers) didn't.\n\n\n\nExit and save the file\n\n4. Run Nethermind in background\nSo now we're ready to go. \nHowever, if you run ./Nethermind.Runner --config  and logout, your process will stop.\nTo avoid this, you can use nohup and the & operator to run your process in the background.\n\nnohup ./Nethermind.Runner --config  &\noptional: If you want to enable Health Checks, run the following:\nnohup ./Nethermind.Runner --config  --HealthChecks.Enabled true &\n\n\n\nThis command will create a new file nohup.out (name can be configured with nohup ... > output.txt) in the nethermind directory, with logs that you can inspect. \nYou can find the process id in order to stop the now backgrounded syncing process with ps:\nroot@ubuntu-s-4vcpu-8gb-nyc3-01:~/nethermind# ps\n    PID TTY          TIME CMD\n   8083 pts/0    00:00:00 bash\n  13059 pts/0    00:07:10 Nethermind.Runn\n  13441 pts/0    00:00:00 ps\nAnd kill it with ps PID like kill 13059\nYou can also check out the Digital Ocean Droplet Activity Dashboard, which should show a large increase in activity while syncing occurs.\n\n\nGo to http://DIGITAL_OCEAN_IP:8545 and you should see the following:\n\n\n\n\n5. Inspect logs and check node's health\nLogs are in two places: nohup.out (or whatever you name your output file) and nethermind/logs/xdai.logs.txt.\nI inspected both sets of logs with the cat filename command\nand once the file got too big tail -n 10 filename to view the newest entries.\nNethermind provides an excellent explanation of what the logs are telling you about the speed of your fast sync.\nI suggest following along and learning about the logs.\nFinally, once your node is synced or near synced, you can confirm your node is in good shape:\nhttp://DIGITAL_OCEAN_IP:8545/health\n\nThanks for reading!\nThis guide was originally submitted by cha0sg0d11.\n"},"plugins/what-is-a-plugin.html":{"url":"plugins/what-is-a-plugin.html","title":"What is a plugin?","keywords":"","body":"What is a plugin?\nDark Forest allows players to customize the default webclient via the plugins system. Plugins are snippets of code that players can write to generate alternate views of game data, automate common gameplay flows, or even reskin the game. Essentially, Dark Forest allows players can interact programmatically with the webclient in any way they'd like.\nWe encourage players to share plugins with the larger community. A community-maintained plugins showcase can be found here, with the underlying source code available in this repository. Follow the instructions in the plugins showcase README to submit your plugin to the repository.\nIt's worth noting that plugins are evaluated in the context of your game and can access all of your private information (including your burner wallet private key!). Additionally, plugins can dynamically load data, which can be switched out from under you. Use these plugins at your own risk.\nTherefore, it can be dangerous to use any plugins that you haven't written/reviewed yourself or by someone you trust completely. You or someone you trust should control the entire pipeline (such as imported dependencies) and should review plugins before you use them.\n"},"plugins/writing-your-first-plugin.html":{"url":"plugins/writing-your-first-plugin.html","title":"Writing your first plugin","keywords":"","body":"Writing your first plugin\nThis article is a stub.
